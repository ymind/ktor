/**
 * A builder that provides ability to build byte packets with no knowledge of it's size.
 * Unlike Java's ByteArrayOutputStream it doesn't copy the whole content every time it's internal buffer overflows
 * but chunks buffers instead. Packet building via [build] function is O(1) operation and only does instantiate
 * a new [ByteReadPacket]. Once a byte packet has been built via [build] function call, the builder could be
 * reused again. You also can discard all written bytes via [reset] or [release]. Please note that an instance of
 * builder need to be terminated either via [build] function invocation or via [release] call otherwise it will
 * cause byte buffer leak so that may have performance impact.
 *
 * Byte packet builder is also an [Appendable] so it does append UTF-8 characters to a packet
 *
 * ```
 * buildPacket {
 *     listOf(1,2,3).joinTo(this, separator = ",")
 * }
 * ```
